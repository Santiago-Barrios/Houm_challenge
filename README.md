### `Information about the project`
This react app is designed with typescript. In its styles it uses bootstrap and animate.css (https://animate.style/). Its folder structure is given to be scalable and maintainable.

It is a project developed in an agile way thinking about using an api (https://pokeapi.co/ version2), from which properties are extracted and then painted on hero cards. Its design is responsive, and it shows 12 resources per screen, it has pagination and a search bar that will allow you to find the image and the pokemon id you want.

The app is deployed in production at https://houm-challenge-pokeapp.netlify.app/, here you can see the final result of this project.
